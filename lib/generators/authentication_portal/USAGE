Description:
    Generates a UI for devise-based authentication portals.  Includes sign-up
    and sign in as well as basic edit profile integration.  Requires you have
    devise installed and have either run the application_helpers generator
    or have implemented app_name and gravatar_for methods yourself.

Example:
    rails generate authentication_portal Thing

    This will create:
        what/will/it/create
